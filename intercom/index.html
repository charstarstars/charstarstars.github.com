      <h1>The Prompt</h1>
      <p>
        The &ldquo;<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6440967/product-design-screen.png">conversation card</a>&rdquo;, appears throughout Intercom: in the inbox, on the user profile, etc.. Re-design it to more heavily focus on lightweight personal conversation, while still supporting advanced features such as &ldquo;assign to&rdquo; and &ldquo;notes&rdquo;. We're not looking for pixel perfect designs, wireframes or barebones mockups will suffice. Please also include a short description detailing the rational for your design.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Utilizes familiar instant messaging and SMS design pattern</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Brings the messaging up to the forefront while still showing the other actions you can perform</strong><br>
          All the messages will show up instead of showing one message at a time and the reply line is reduced to one row to encourage lighter weight messaging
        </li>
        <li><strong>Removes and reduces extraneous elements and variables.</strong><br>
            The Date is more muted and in closer proximity to the message itself and the tagging is next to the other functions
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="process">
      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>
        My process of design revolves around a cycle.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate user needs</li>
        <li>Design around those needs</li>
        <li>Test whether the design meets those needs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        At the core of the field of human-computer interaction, is the drive to push for user-centered design rather than design influenced by engineering or marketing and this design process reflects that idea. In the end, it's people that matter, and it's their experience with the product that matters.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="evaluate">
      <h2>1. Evaluate User Needs</h2>
      <p>
        Here we can say that the user is either the client company using Intercom or the end user communicating with the client company.  In an ideal world, I might conduct user research to derive user needs, but since we don't live in an ideal world, I can only make an educated guess at what the user may need out of the Intercom conversation card.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of the client company, their needs could be to create a more efficient workflow.  In the case of the end user, their needs may be to have a more personable experience in communicating with the client company. In any case, our end conclusion that derived the prompt in the first place would be to create a conversation card that focuses on lightweight personal communication.
      </p>

      <h2>
        2. Design around those needs
      </h2>
      <p>
        I came up with two ways of creating lighter weight personal communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        First we explore hierarchy of information and make the messaging elements more prominent and hiding elements unrelated to the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, we explore familiar design patterns such as those used in messaging applications like Messages for iOS/Mac or Hangouts for Android/Web. These applications are known to be faster modes of communication and using their design patterns may inspire lighter weight personal communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the wireframe mock-up of the design:
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/designs-01.png?_subject_uid=26728682&w=AABOPD6PuNFz0Ba_zcoG4ULU4sAEXPQ8SQcjILhT42yqwA" alt="" >
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="test">
      <h2>3. Test whether the design meets those needs</h2>
      <p>
        Again, in an ideal world I might do more qualitative user research talking to real users and performing some traditional usability tests on the design prototypes. Since we do not live in an ideal world, we can possibly come up with parameters for success for an A/B test or tasks to test for a usability test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parameters to measure could include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of messages sent</li>
        <li>Length of messages</li>
        <li>Speed of reply</li>
        <li>Speed at which cases are resolved</li>
        <li>Time on site</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, we shouldn't overlook the high-level goals of the conversation card, so we would sanity check to make sure the original needs of having a conversation card are met.
