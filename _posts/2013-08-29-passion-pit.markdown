Every year the [Activities Board](http://activitiesboard.org) Concerts Committee holds a Spring Concert during [Carnegie Mellon](http://cmu.edu)'s [Spring Carnival](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~sc0v/). It's an outdoor concert with over 2000 students and alumni in attendance along with several hundred members of the Pittsburgh community.  The Spring 2012 concert headlined [Passion Pit](http://passionpitmusic.com/), an upbeat Indie Pop band.

## Process
Passion Pit has a  pop sound and I wanted to demonstrate that in loud colors and swooping shapes.  I was inspired by the style of [Limkis](http://limkis-art.com/) who uses vectors and saturated colors to make impressive realistic portraits.

### Initial Artwork
On my first attempt, I created a background in Illustrator

    <span class="caption">Backdrop for the text. Lots of semi-transparent layers of color inspired by <a href="http://limkis-art.com/">LimKis</a></span>

    <span class="caption">Initial text laid out</span>

On my first draft, the Concerts Committee made critiques on the design regarding the color (it looks too much like a museum ad) and the typography.  Based on their feedback, I made several dozen iterations on color and typography

    <span class="caption">I went with Century Gothic to be consistent with Passion Pit's design and Helvetica for the rest of the text</span>
