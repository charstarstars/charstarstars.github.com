I bought a pocket projector last year on [woot](http://www.woot.com/offers/rechargeable-50-lm-led-pico-projector) with the intent of watching movies on the ceiling of my dorm.  This turns out to be not as easy as planned due to monetary and space constraints.

Now that I have the necessary monetary and space resources though, I bought a swing arm lamp and roll of sticky back velcro to clamp the lamp to the back of my bed (added bonus: reading light) and velcroed the projector onto the head of the lamp for easy switching between projecting onto the ceiling and projecting onto the wall.

Behold the result:

<div class="with-caption">
  <img src="/assets/images/projector.jpg" alt="Projecting onto the wall"> <span class="caption">View from my lamp projecting onto the wall.</span>
</div>

Totally worth it, now I just need to get chromecast to go wireless.
