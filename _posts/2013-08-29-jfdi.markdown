Since working full time as a product designer, I've been wondering more and more about what's in a design. What does good design mean? How does it affect the products we ship? What about a bad design? Is design important? As the lead designer at my company, it's my job to care the most about the design of our product. However what does it means for other people? How does design influence the average person?

For me, a good design will:

1. Make the product usable and understandable (along with Rams's ten principles of good design)
2. Instill a sense of trust in the user
3. Represent the identity and culture of the company to the outside world

Key to this discussion is the third point. *Represent the identity and culture of the company to the outside world*.

### Your identity, in a design
