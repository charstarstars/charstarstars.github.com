I purchased a pocket projector last year in hopes of watching movies on the ceiling. The problem is that the connectivity ports were on the side that would be on the ground if projected onto the ceiling

Possible solutions included: just use other items to prop up the projector from the botto, use a mirror to avoid blocking the I/O ports, or some how affix the projector to another object.

I chose to use a swing arm lamp clamped to the headboard of my bed frame and attach the projector onto the lamp with velcro.  It's actually fairly effective.
