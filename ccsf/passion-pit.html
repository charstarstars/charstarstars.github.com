<p>Every year, Carnegie Mellon University brings in a popular music artist to campus which gathers a crowd of up to 800 for the capacity indoors and unlimited capacity outdoors. </p>

	In April 2012, we had Passion Pit play outdoors and I created the brandind and design for the show including posters, tickets, t-shirts, drawstring bags, and video assets.
