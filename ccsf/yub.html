	I worked at a startup, Yub, as their Lead Product Designer in 2013. In the fast-paced startup environment I created the  visual identity for Yub through style guide, logo design, and illustration using HTML/CSS, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. 
	Additionally, I generated marketing materials for affiliates and brands along with mocks of ads.
