  <h1>Hi, you found me!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Ariel. I do things. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My current thing is making art in triplicate on <a href="/missuteki">missuteki</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I owned the core text editing experience at <a href="https://moment.dev">
      Moment</a>, led the web platform team at <a href="https://samsara.com">Samsara</a>, 
    and built internal tools validated by real user feedback for <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">
      Lyft</a> as a Front-end Software Engineer.
  </p> 
  <p>
    When I'm not mashing at the keyboard, I'm eating 85%+ dark chocolate, teaching group
    fitness, and going with the flow. I live in San Francisco; 
    maybe you'll bump into me at Mission Cliffs or find that we have 
    2 degrees of separation on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/arielliu">
    LinkedIn</a>.
