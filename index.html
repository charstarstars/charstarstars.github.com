  <h1>Hi, you found me!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Ariel. I do things. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My current thing is making art in triplicate on <a href="/missuteki">missuteki</a>, 
    learning out loud on <a href="https://medium.com/@charstarstars/">Medium</a>, and 
    creating a narrative around the idea of <a href="/gopayattention">paying attention</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I built internal tools validated by real user feedback 
    for <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> as a Front-end Software Engineer.
  </p> 
  <p>
    When I'm not mashing at the keyboard, I'm consuming massive amounts of chai, 
    knitting hats, and making things up as I go along. I live in San Francisco; 
    maybe you'll bump into me at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIabgPX14R4">
    Mission Cliffs</a>, or notice an occasional retweet on 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/charstarstars">Twitter</a>, or find that we have 
    2 degrees of separation on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/arielliu">
    LinkedIn.</a>
